<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt; font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>Street-Level Surveillance: An Urban Panopticon</strong></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ba372a;"><strong>What is an Urban Panopticon / a surveillance city?</strong></span><strong><br /></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A panopticon is a circular prison where a guard is stationed at the center of the building with the ability to see all inmates in cells along the building's circumference. However, the inmates cannot see the guard, obfuscating the known and creating a constant paranoia and sense of always being watched. The indiscriminate use of street-level surveillance technologies in public and private urban spaces can be likened to the surveillance structure of a panopticon. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today's smart cities have become a covert tool for increasing surveillance, corporate profits, and social control.&nbsp;</span></i></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ba372a; font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>What are we investigating?&nbsp; Why does this matter?&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'andale mono', times;">This study aims to discuss the impact of data collection and surveillance technologies, their increasing privatization, and their inevitable consequences in power imbalances at urban governance level. Through this lens, this study will also attempt to demonstrate the spatial and political implications of employing privately-owned video surveillance and facial recognition technologies by law enforcement agencies. We will focus on three major US cities to study how the cities&rsquo; police forces are deploying privately owned surveillance technology. We hope to draw a connection between the role of private capitalist interests in public policing strategies, and investigate whether the decentralized nature of digital surveillance technologies correlates with urban spatial degradation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement agencies are turning to increasingly sophisticated surveillance technologies to closely track and monitor civilians. What were previously only military-grade technologies are now being deployed at the street-level, making cities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a targeted landscape for data extraction. We believe that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;city governments eager to take advantage of new technologies must act as responsible gatekeepers and public stewards in structuring their technology to protect equity and fundamental rights.&rdquo;</span></i><i></i></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ba372a; font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>Looking at Police Surveillance Data</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'andale mono', times;">The Atlas of Surveillance Dataset is a compilation and organization of already existing open-source information&mdash; an effort conducted by the Electronic Frontier foundation the Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno. The data collection process consists of crowdsourcing and data aggregation. The crowdsourcing data collection uses a tool called &lsquo;Report Back&rsquo; which automatically distributes data research assignments to volunteers and students. More than 800 students and volunteers since November of 2021 have contributed to this research. The data aggregation aspect consists of collecting and reorganizing information already compiled on other public surveillance technology datasets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'andale mono', times;">A major limitation of this dataset is that sources providing the data are likely not always reliable and accurate. For example, a government agency data source may selectively choose which data to share, and which data to withhold. Journalism-sourced data may have been misinterpreted during the reporting process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ba372a; font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>Technologies used by Police:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>Cell Site Simulator</strong></span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Cell Site Simulators, more commonly known as &ldquo;Stringrays&rdquo; or<span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;"> international mobile subscriber identity-catchers (</span><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;"> IMSI catchers), are utilized by police without warrants to eavesdrop and intercept SMS messages, cell phone calls, and other mobile traffic. Cell Site Simulators trick phones to connect to them by pretending to be a traditional cell-phone tower. Some countries such as Germany strictly regulate Cell Site Simulator due to civil privacy and liberty concerns.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>Drones</strong></span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, are aircrafts controlled remotely or automatically without anyone on board. Using sensors and Global Positioning Software (GPS), drones navigate the skies while capturing highly precise data. At the base level, drones capture high-definition photo and video footage as well as precise geo-located data. Drones adopted by law enforcement agencies are additionally equipped with sophisticated data extraction and surveillance technologies that are capable of detecting landscape topography data, collecting license plate information, intercepting cell phone calls, and reading biometric data for facial recognition.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>Body Cameras</strong></span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Body cameras are small cameras clipped onto the uniform of a police officer&rsquo;s chest or worn as a headset. Data collected from police body cameras include video and audio footage, time stamps of incidents with the public, and are often equipped with bluetooth and live-streaming software, facial recognition. Body cameras are a double edged sword&mdash;serving as a both public accountability tool and a surveillance strategy at once.&nbsp;</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>CCTV&rsquo;s + Traffic Cams</strong></span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Live, high-speed traffic video footage from cameras mounted on street intersection infrastructure. Footage includes location, timestamp, automated license plate reader (ALPR) software, and facial recognition software.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>Home Cams</strong></span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Private companies that provide security camera surveillance, often in the front entryway area of a person&rsquo;s home. Law enforcement have been requesting civilians to share their private footage with public police departments in order to further criminal investigative cases. Home cams are a special case of law enforcement using non-government owned surveillance technology.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>Facial Recognition</strong></span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Facial recognition technology matches an individual's identity using software that compares photos, videos, or in real-time facial biometric data. Facial recognition software is often connected to surveillance cameras distributed throughout smart cities, identifying and tracking individuals as they move throughout the city.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">Predictive Policing (Preemptive, Proactive, AI)</strong></span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Predictive policing is an analysis of crime-related data and software used by police departments to preemptively decide which groups of people and which&nbsp; neighborhoods should be given more police presence. Large sets of data are analyzed with machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. </span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">Video Analytics</strong></span>
        <ul>
            <li><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Computer software used in combination with video footage from surveillance cameras to analyze information such as facial identification, movement patterns, etc.</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ba372a; font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>Technologies employed by Agencies in the US and where they come from</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'andale mono', times;">We connected police surveillance technologies across the US and the corresponding technology&rsquo;s country of origin. China stands out as the largest vendor for US surveillance technologies&mdash;almost entirely due to drone manufacturing. France stood out as a major supplied to the US for facial recognition technology.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong>Implications of International Firms and Data:</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">Drones and China</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Drone-generated data also enables national security threats. DJI, the Chinese tech company responsible for manufacturing a majority of the US law enforcement agencies&rsquo; drones, was recently added to the US Department of Treasury&rsquo;s investment blacklist after information was uncovered regarding DJI&rsquo;s role in surveilling the Uyghur Muslim population in the Xinjiang Region&rsquo;s concentration camps.<span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;"> Cyber security researchers have since found the data collected from DJI aligns with Chinese government surveillance practices, which require drones to be linked to a user&rsquo;s identity,&rdquo; giving the Chinese government access to images, videos, biometric data, location data, and all other data generated by drones.</span><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;"> The US federal government has largely stopped using drones manufactured by Chinese companies, although state and local-level enforcement continues to deploy them. DJI&rsquo;s case reflects the increasing security risk of international data leaks resulting from the surveillance technology sector in the US&mdash;even if a technology gets banned, the data already generated from them persists, likely in intelligence offices abroad that closely monitor the data</span><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-size: 1rem;">.</strong></span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times; font-size: 18pt; color: #ba372a;"><strong>Types of Surveillance Technologies by Agency</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times; font-size: 18pt; color: #ba372a;"><strong>Regulations</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'andale mono', times;">At the current status quo, federal policy lacks a framework to regulate how governmental agencies may use surveillance technologies and data. Although aerial surveillance is almost ubiquitously used by law enforcement across the nation, Officials do not need to obtain search warrants when it comes to many surveillance operations such as flying drones over civilians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Stored Communications Act of 1986: federal law that prohibits an &ldquo;electronic communications service provider&rdquo; from &ldquo;sharing users communication and account records, subject to a list of exceptions.&rdquo; There's an exception for law enforcement, but none for defendants. Police can protect themselves, but individuals cant.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Proposed Legislation</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Restricting drone usage by law enforcement is an important first step toward regulating data and privacy from drones.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In 2021, Senator Jessica Ramos and Representative Ron Kim proposed a Senate Bill S675 and Assembly Bill A3311 to establish the &ldquo;protect our privacy (POP) act.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The bill proposes that law enforcement officials be federally required to obtain a warrant before deploying a drone to surveil any protest, demonstration, or investigation, and that drone footage is not linked to facial recognition software.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Legislators and technologists must also consider increasing the transparency of the process by which local police departments acquire drones. In NYC, the NYPD can currently utilize an appropriations loophole to pay for an unlimited number of drones using federal grants and private donations without any prior local oversight.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: #ba372a;"><span style="font-family: andale mono, times;"><strong>In the news</strong></span></span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Clearview facial recognition</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Clearview is a facial recognition firm widely used by police departments around the nation, including NYPD and police departments in California and Texas. Clearview claims to be the &ldquo;worlds&rsquo; largest facial network&rdquo; trusted by law enforcement, but non-consensually collects billions of images of faces from online accounts such as Venmo, Facebook, and Youtube. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Derrick Ingram, Minneapolis 2020</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August 2020, the NYPD used facial recognition to track down a Black Lives Matter protestor, Derrick Ingram. Ingram was a leader in NYC&rsquo;s BLM demonstrations and did much of the digital organizing and educated protestors on the risks of cell phone taps and social media monitoring. Police used a photo from Ingrams Instagram page to match his identity, and later showed up outside of his apartment with drones hovering over his roof, urging Ingram to voluntarily surrender.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the NYPD has used facial recognition in at least 22,000 cases since 2017</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Minneapolis George Floyd Protests, 2020</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many believe that the data generated and monitored as a result of drone surveillance poses significant privacy threats to citizens as well as security threats to the nation. During the 2020 George Floyd protests in Minneapolis, US Customs and Border Protection quietly flew a drone over protestors, raising concerns about civic data privacy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though the drones allegedly did not collect facial recognition or other personally-identifiable data from protestors, an investigation from MIT Technology Review uncovered evidence that law enforcement in Minneapolis built a sophisticated real-time data-sharing system that exchanged information about protestors with SWAT and command centers. Thousands of protestors, most of whom were not engaged in illegal activities, were subject to their sensitive data being mass-extracted from them without search warrants.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-family: 'andale mono', times; color: #ba372a; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Control Surveillance&mdash; not no surveillance</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Though surveillance technologies and data extraction can be extremely dangerous, it would be an oversight not to address their positive impacts and capacity to improve city life and safety. Surveillance cameras can keep an eye out for crime in public spaces and hold those involved accountable. In criminal investigations, video footage serves as extremely valuable&nbsp; evidence that helps build and strengthen cases. Data collected and analysis about our cities can help inform service improvements and make systems and processes much more time, money, and energy efficient.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Surveillance technologies can be effectively utilized to serve the public good. We are not saying no surveillance, we are saying control surveillance. When George Floyd was being killed, the police officer was being surveilled by Darnella Frazier, the woman who video recorded the officer. When there is an abuse of power, surveillance technologies also have the capacity to hold abusers accountable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: 'andale mono', times;">Planning Implications</span></p>
