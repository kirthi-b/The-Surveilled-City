<p><strong>TITLE:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Street-Level Surveillance: An Urban Panopticon</strong></p>

    <li aria-level="2"><strong>What is an Urban Panopticon / a surveillance city?</strong><strong><br /><br /></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A panopticon is a circular prison where a guard is stationed at the center of the building with the ability to see all inmates in cells along the building's circumference. However, the inmates cannot see the guard, obfuscating the known and creating a constant paranoia and sense of always being watched. The indiscriminate use of street-level surveillance technologies in public and private urban spaces can be likened to the surveillance structure of a panopticon. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today's smart cities have become a covert tool for increasing surveillance, corporate profits, and social control.&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><br /><strong></strong></p>

    <li aria-level="2"><strong>What are we investigating?&nbsp; Why does this matter?&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This study aims to discuss the impact of data collection and surveillance technologies, their increasing privatization, and their inevitable consequences in power imbalances at urban governance level. Through this lens, this study will also attempt to demonstrate the spatial and political implications of employing privately-owned video surveillance and facial recognition technologies by law enforcement agencies. We will focus on three major US cities to study how the cities&rsquo; police forces are deploying privately owned surveillance technology. We hope to draw a connection between the role of private capitalist interests in public policing strategies, and investigate whether the decentralized nature of digital surveillance technologies correlates with urban spatial degradation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Law enforcement agencies are turning to increasingly sophisticated surveillance technologies to closely track and monitor civilians. What were previously only military-grade technologies are now being deployed at the street-level, making cities </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a targeted landscape for data extraction. We believe that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;city governments eager to take advantage of new technologies must act as responsible gatekeepers and public stewards in structuring their technology to protect equity and fundamental rights.&rdquo; </span></i></p>

        <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Atlas of Surveillance Dataset is a compilation and organization of already existing open-source information&mdash; an effort conducted by the Electronic Frontier foundation the Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno. The data collection process consists of crowdsourcing and data aggregation. The crowdsourcing data collection uses a tool called &lsquo;Report Back&rsquo; which automatically distributes data research assignments to volunteers and students. More than 800 students and volunteers since November of 2021 have contributed to this research. The data aggregation aspect consists of collecting and reorganizing information already compiled on other public surveillance technology datasets.</span></li>
    </ol>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A major limitation of this dataset is that sources providing the data are likely not always reliable and accurate. For example, a government agency data source may selectively choose which data to share, and which data to withhold. Journalism-sourced data may have been misinterpreted during the reporting process.&nbsp;</span></p>

Cell Site Simulators trick phones to connect to them by pretending to be a traditional cell-phone tower. Some countries such as Germany strictly regulate Cell Site Simulator due to civil privacy and liberty concerns.&nbsp;</span></li>

    <li aria-level="5"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drones, also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, are aircrafts controlled remotely or automatically without anyone on board. Using sensors and Global Positioning Software (GPS), drones navigate the skies while capturing highly precise data. At the base level, drones capture high-definition photo and video footage as well as precise geo-located data. Drones adopted by law enforcement agencies are additionally equipped with sophisticated data extraction and surveillance technologies that are capable of detecting landscape topography data, collecting license plate information, intercepting cell phone calls, and reading biometric data for facial recognition.</span></li>

                    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In August 2020, the NYPD used facial recognition to track down a Black Lives Matter protestor, Derrick Ingram. Ingram was a leader in NYC&rsquo;s BLM demonstrations and did much of the digital organizing and educated protestors on the risks of cell phone taps and social media monitoring. Police used a photo from Ingrams Instagram page to match his identity, and later showed up outside of his apartment with drones hovering over his roof, urging Ingram to voluntarily surrender.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the NYPD has used facial recognition in at least 22,000 cases since 2017</span></li>

DJI, the Chinese tech company responsible for manufacturing a majority of the US law enforcement agencies&rsquo; drones, was recently added to the US Department of Treasury&rsquo;s investment blacklist after information was uncovered regarding DJI&rsquo;s role in surveilling the Uyghur Muslim population in the Xinjiang Region&rsquo;s concentration camps.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Cyber security researchers have since found the data collected from DJI aligns with Chinese government surveillance practices, which require drones to be linked to a user&rsquo;s identity,&rdquo; giving the Chinese government access to images, videos, biometric data, location data, and all other data generated by drones.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The US federal government has largely stopped using drones manufactured by Chinese companies, although state and local-level enforcement continues to deploy them. DJI&rsquo;s case reflects the increasing security risk of international data leaks resulting from the surveillance technology sector in the US&mdash;even if a technology gets banned, the data already generated from them persists, likely in intelligence offices abroad that closely monitor the data</span><strong>.</strong></li>

                    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="4"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many believe that the data generated and monitored as a result of drone surveillance poses significant privacy threats to citizens as well as security threats to the nation. During the 2020 George Floyd protests in Minneapolis, US Customs and Border Protection quietly flew a drone over protestors, raising concerns about civic data privacy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Though the drones allegedly did not collect facial recognition or other personally-identifiable data from protestors, an investigation from MIT Technology Review uncovered evidence that law enforcement in Minneapolis built a sophisticated real-time data-sharing system that exchanged information about protestors with SWAT and command centers. Thousands of protestors, most of whom were not engaged in illegal activities, were subject to their sensitive data being mass-extracted from them without search warrants. (EXPAND ON OSN)</span></li>

Surveillance cameras can keep an eye out for crime in public spaces and hold those involved accountable. In criminal investigations, video footage serves as extremely valuable&nbsp; evidence that helps build and strengthen cases.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surveillance technologies can be effectively utilized to serve the public good. We are not saying no surveillance, we are saying control surveillance.

When there is an abuse of power, surveillance technologies also have the capacity to hold abusers accountable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

This is a document that is written in markdown. What is markdown? It is a 'markup language' that allows you to format plain text in a way that is easily converted to many different formats. For example, this document was written in markdown but will be used as an webpage and converted into HTML.  

To present and turn in your final projects for Conflict Urbanism: Puerto Rico Now you will be editing this template. You will include all of the text of your paper here, along with any and all images, maps, videos, or other materials that you produce.  

[This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax. But to make things easier for you we are including a cheat sheet of the main things you need to know here.  

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions  
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:  

![description of image](/conflict_urbanism_sp2022/images/sample_image.png)

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  


All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
